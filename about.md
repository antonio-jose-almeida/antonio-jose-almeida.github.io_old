I am an IT enthusiasm with a diverse background. I started my career as an Electrical Engineer and developed into a Network and Systems Engineer.

I've been working on networks since 1998. Almost all of that time was spent in a large retail company in Portugal where I'm mainly focused on the data center network.

I have been constantly on a steep learning curve in order to continuously improve and achieve multidisciplinary in IT expertise. Continuous learning, being a team player, a high degree of accountability, and technical excellence is what I am known for.

In this blog I will try to document some of the challenges that I tackle every day that I think may be useful and interesting.
